## Installation & Setup
No additional setup required. The support system is integrated into the existing dashboard and works immediately.

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. Click "সহায়তা" in navigation or use floating button
2. Choose appropriate support option
3. For emergencies, click emergency buttons for direct calling
4. Use chat widget for immediate assistance
5. Access FAQ for common questions

### For Developers
1. Support system auto-initializes on page load
2. All event listeners are set up automatically
3. Analytics data stored in localStorage
4. Customizable responses in `getAgentResponse()` function

## Customization

### Adding New Emergency Numbers
```javascript
// In makeEmergencyCall function, add new numbers:
const emergencyNumbers = {
    'fire': '999',
    'police': '999',
    'newService': '16xxx'
};
```

### Modifying Chat Responses
```javascript
// In getAgentResponse function, add new keywords:
const responses = {
    'newKeyword': 'Your response here',
    // ... existing responses
};
```

### Styling Customization
```css
/* Modify CSS variables in :root for global changes */
:root {
    --primary-color: #004AAD;
    --secondary-color: #00C6FF;
    --accent-color: #FF6B6B;
}
```

## Security Considerations
- All external links open in new tabs
- Email templates prevent XSS with encodeURIComponent
- No sensitive data stored in localStorage
- Phone number validation before calling

## Performance
- Lazy initialization after DOM load
- Event delegation for better performance
- CSS animations hardware-accelerated
- Local storage for analytics (no server calls)

## Accessibility
- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast color schemes
- Screen reader friendly structure

## Future Enhancements
- Backend integration for real chat agents
- Push notifications for support responses
- Multi-language support
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Integration with CRM systems
